## Installation

To get started with LLMs, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLMs.git
cd LLMs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to use the project:

### Import Necessary Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries required for processing and model training:

```python
# Example of importing libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# Add other relevant imports
```

### Create a Sample Dataset

This section covers how to create a sample dataset:

```python
# Example code to create a dataset
data = {
    'text': ['sample text 1', 'sample text 2', 'sample text 3'],
    'label': [0, 1, 0]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### Tokenize the Dataset

Tokenizing the dataset is a crucial step for preparing text data for model training:

```python
# Example code to tokenize dataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokens = tokenizer(df['text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
```

## Features

- **Dataset Creation:** Easily create and manipulate datasets.
- **Tokenization:** Leverage powerful tokenization tools from popular transformer libraries.
- **Model Training:** (Add details if relevant)
